# Implementation of Paper "Parameter Estimation for Linear Dynamic Systems"

This is an implementation of the EM algorithm described in the paper [Parameter Estimation for Linear Dynamic Systems by Ghahramani and Hinton][GH96]
in conjunction with the E-step described in [From Hidden Markov Models to Linear Dynamical Systems by Minka][M99].

All formulas referenced only by a number reference to the above paper, except states otherwise.
